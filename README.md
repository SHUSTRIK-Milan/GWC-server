## ðŸ“¥ Installation

**Note:**

1. **Local use (localhost)**  
   If you plan to use it locally, youâ€™ll need to connect all players using the GWebcam addon to the same network.  
   This can be done via apps like **Radmin VPN** or **ZeroTier**.  
   Alternatively, you can open the required ports specified in the `".env"` configuration file.

2. **Server use**  
   If youâ€™re a server developer and decide to use the GWebcam addon, youâ€™ll need to host **GWC-server** on your server.  
   All you need to do is run the appropriate executable for your hostingâ€™s operating system.
